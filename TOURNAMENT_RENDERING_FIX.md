# Tournament Rendering Optimization Fix

## Issue Description
Tournament screen stops rendering and loads back when cursor movement stops, indicating performance throttling during mouse events.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Excessive Re-renders**: Tournament components re-rendering on every cursor movement
2. **Heavy Framer Motion Animations**: Multiple motion components causing GPU strain
3. **Unoptimized Event Handlers**: Functions recreated on every render
4. **Expensive Backdrop Blur**: Heavy visual effects causing rendering pauses

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Heavy Framer Motion Animations
**File**: `src/components/arena/UnifiedTournamentHub.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Replaced `motion.div` with regular `div` for tournament cards
- Removed `whileHover`, `initial`, and `animate` props
- Used pure CSS animations instead of JS-based animations

```tsx
// Before: Heavy motion components
<motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
>

// After: Lightweight CSS animations
<div
    className="... hover:scale-[1.02] will-change-transform"
>
```

### 2. Added React.memo and useCallback Optimizations
**Changes**:
- Wrapped `TournamentCard` with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Added `useMemo` for tournament lists to prevent recalculation

```tsx
// Memoized component
const TournamentCard = React.memo<{ tournament: BackendTournament }>(...);

// Memoized handlers
const handleJoinTournament = useCallback(..., [userAddress, onStartQuiz]);
const handleStartTournament = useCallback(..., [userAddress]);

// Memoized data
const memoizedTournaments = useMemo(() => tournaments, [tournaments]);
```

### 3. Optimized Scroll Event Handling
**Changes**:
- Increased debounce timeout to 150ms
- Removed dependencies from scroll useEffect to prevent re-runs
- Added conditional state updates to prevent unnecessary renders
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother updates

```tsx
// Optimized scroll handler
scrollTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        // Only update if values changed
        setShowScrollTop(prev => prev !== newValue ? newValue : prev);
    });
}, 150);
```

### 4. Reduced Visual Effect Intensity
**Changes**:
- Changed `backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-sm`
- Reduced transition durations from 300ms to 200ms
- Added `will-change` hints for better GPU optimization
- Reduced gradient opacity for lighter effects

```css
/* Lighter effects for better performance */
.backdrop-blur-sm /* instead of backdrop-blur-md */
.transition-all duration-200 /* instead of duration-300 */
.will-change-transform /* GPU optimization hints */
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Rendering pauses during cursor movement
- ❌ Heavy Framer Motion animations
- ❌ Excessive component re-renders
- ❌ Unoptimized event handlers

### After Fix:
- ✅ Smooth rendering during cursor movement
- ✅ Lightweight CSS-only animations
- ✅ Memoized components prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Optimized event handlers with stable references

## Technical Details

### React Performance Optimizations:
1. **React.memo**: Prevents re-rendering when props haven't changed
2. **useCallback**: Maintains stable function references
3. **useMemo**: Prevents expensive recalculations
4. **Reduced useEffect dependencies**: Prevents excessive effect re-runs

### CSS Performance Optimizations:
1. **will-change hints**: Tells browser to optimize for transformations
2. **Reduced blur intensity**: Less GPU-intensive backdrop effects
3. **Shorter transitions**: Faster, more responsive animations
4. **CSS transforms over JS**: Hardware-accelerated animations

### Browser Optimizations:
1. **Passive event listeners**: Better scroll performance
2. **requestAnimationFrame**: Synced with browser refresh rate
3. **Debounced handlers**: Reduced event frequency
4. **GPU layer promotion**: `will-change-transform` creates composite layers

## Expected Results
1. **No Rendering Pauses**: Smooth operation during cursor movement
2. **Better Responsiveness**: Faster hover effects and interactions
3. **Improved Performance**: Lower CPU/GPU usage
4. **Stable Frame Rate**: Consistent 60fps animations

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- Continuous rendering during cursor movement
- Smooth hover effects without pauses
- Responsive scroll behavior
- No visual glitches or stuttering

**Status**: ✅ OPTIMIZED - Tournament screen should now render smoothly without pauses
