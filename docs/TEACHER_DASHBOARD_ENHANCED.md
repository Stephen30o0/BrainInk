# BrainInk Teacher Dashboard - Enhanced Backend Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced teacher dashboard system with real backend integration, comprehensive API endpoints, and improved functionality for AI-powered educational insights.

## Architecture Update

### Backend Services

#### 1. Main Teacher Backend (`teacher-backend/`)
- **FastAPI** service with PostgreSQL database
- **OCR Integration** with PaddleOCR microservice
- **K.A.N.A. AI** integration for content analysis
- **JWT Authentication** and role-based access control
- **Real-time WebSocket** support for live updates

#### 2. Enhanced Frontend Service (`src/services/teacherService.ts`)
- **Hybrid API Integration** - tries real API first, falls back to mock data
- **Progressive Enhancement** - works offline with mock data
- **TypeScript Interfaces** - comprehensive type safety
- **Authentication Management** - JWT token handling

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Real Backend Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced API client with authentication
class TeacherAPIClient {
  private baseURL: string;
  private authToken: string | null = null;
  
  // Auto-retry with fallback to mock data
  async get<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T>
  async post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<T>
  async postFormData<T>(endpoint: string, formData: FormData): Promise<T>
}
```

### 2. Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL** with proper relationships
- **Teachers, Students, Classes** with enrollment tracking
- **Analysis Results** with OCR and AI insights
- **AI Suggestions** for teaching recommendations
- **Improvement Plans** with TownSquare integration

### 3. Enhanced APIs

#### Student Management
- `GET /api/students` - Get all students for teacher
- `GET /api/students/{id}` - Get individual student profile
- `GET /api/class/metrics` - Get class performance metrics

#### File Analysis
- `POST /api/analyze/upload` - Upload files for OCR and AI analysis
- Supports: JPG, PNG, PDF, handwritten notes
- Returns: OCR text, confidence scores, AI insights

#### AI Insights
- `GET /api/ai-suggestions` - Get K.A.N.A. powered teaching suggestions
- `POST /api/improvement-plan/send` - Send improvement plans to students
- `GET /api/analytics/trends` - Get performance analytics

### 4. Security Features
- **JWT Authentication** with role-based access
- **File Upload Validation** with type and size limits
- **API Rate Limiting** to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration** for secure cross-origin requests

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to teacher backend
cd teacher-backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Set up PostgreSQL database
createdb brainink_teacher
psql brainink_teacher < schema.sql

# Run the backend
python main.py
```

### 2. OCR Service Setup

```bash
# Navigate to OCR service
cd teacher-ocr-service

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run OCR service
python main.py
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

The frontend automatically detects if the backend is available and falls back to mock data if not. This allows for:

- **Development without backend** - Mock data for UI development
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Real features when backend is ready
- **Graceful Degradation** - Continues working if backend goes down

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Teacher login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout

### Teacher Profile
- `GET /api/teacher/profile` - Get teacher profile
- `PUT /api/teacher/profile` - Update teacher profile
- `POST /api/teacher/settings` - Update settings

### Student Management
- `GET /api/students` - List all students
- `GET /api/students/{id}` - Get student details
- `PUT /api/students/{id}` - Update student info

### Analysis & AI
- `POST /api/analyze/upload` - Upload and analyze files
- `GET /api/analyze/results` - Get analysis history
- `GET /api/ai-suggestions` - Get AI recommendations
- `POST /api/improvement-plan/send` - Send improvement plan

### Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/trends` - Performance trends
- `GET /api/analytics/class/{id}` - Class analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/student/{id}` - Student analytics

## Environment Variables

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload** → OCR Service → Extract text and equations
2. **OCR Results** → K.A.N.A. AI → Generate insights and suggestions
3. **AI Analysis** → Teacher Dashboard → Display actionable recommendations
4. **Improvement Plans** → TownSquare → Notify students with gamified missions

## Key Features

### 1. OCR-Powered Note Analysis
- Extracts text from handwritten notes
- Recognizes mathematical equations and formulas
- Handles cursive writing and messy handwriting
- Outputs structured JSON for AI processing

### 2. K.A.N.A. AI Integration
- Subject classification and difficulty assessment
- Learning gap identification
- Personalized suggestion generation
- Progress tracking and trend analysis

### 3. TownSquare Integration

- Create gamified missions and challenges
- Reward students with XP and badges
- Enable teacher-student communication

### 4. Real-time Analytics
- Live class performance metrics
- Student engagement tracking
- Progress visualization with charts

2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **File Validation**: Type, size, and content checking
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
5. **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for student data
6. **Audit Trail**: Log all teacher actions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket for live teacher collaboration
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for predictive insights
3. **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android teacher app
4. **Offline Mode**: PWA with offline capability
5. **Integration APIs**: Connect with existing school systems

## Testing

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd teacher-backend
pytest

# Run frontend tests
cd ..
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  teacher-backend:
    build: ./teacher-backend
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/brainink_teacher
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
  
  ocr-service:
    build: ./teacher-ocr-service
    ports:
      - "8001:8001"
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=brainink_teacher
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

### Production Considerations
- Use managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- Deploy OCR service with GPU support for better performance
- Implement Redis for caching and session management
- Use CDN for file storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- Set up monitoring and logging (Sentry, DataDog)

## Conclusion

The enhanced teacher dashboard provides a comprehensive, AI-powered platform for educators to:
- Analyze student work with advanced OCR and AI
- Get actionable insights for improving teaching
- Send personalized improvement plans to students
- Track class performance with real-time analytics
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing Brain Ink ecosystem
