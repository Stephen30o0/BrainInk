# Tournament Screen Glitching Fix Report

## Issue Description
The tournament screen was glitching when moving the cursor, causing visual artifacts and poor user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis
The glitching was caused by multiple performance issues:

1. **Conflicting Animations**: Framer Motion `whileHover` effects competing with CSS hover animations
2. **Intensive Backdrop Blur**: Heavy `backdrop-blur-md` effects causing GPU strain
3. **Frequent Scroll Event Updates**: Scroll handlers triggering state updates too frequently
4. **Layout Thrashing**: Multiple layout calculations during hover effects

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Optimized Scroll Handling
**File**: `src/components/arena/UnifiedTournamentHub.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Increased debounce timeout from 50ms to 100ms
- Added `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother scroll updates
- Used passive event listeners for better performance
- Added resize event debouncing (200ms)

```typescript
// Before: Frequent updates causing glitching
scrollTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    setShowScrollTop(scrollTop > 50 && isScrollable);
    setShowScrollBottom(scrollTop < scrollHeight - clientHeight - 50 && isScrollable);
}, 50);

// After: Optimized with requestAnimationFrame
scrollTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        setShowScrollTop(scrollTop > 50 && isScrollable);
        setShowScrollBottom(scrollTop < scrollHeight - clientHeight - 50 && isScrollable);
    });
}, 100);
```

### 2. Replaced Framer Motion Hover Effects with CSS
**Changes**:
- Removed `whileHover` and `whileTap` from motion components
- Replaced with CSS `hover:scale-105` and `active:scale-95`
- Added `will-change-transform` for GPU acceleration
- Reduced transition durations from 300ms to 200ms

```tsx
// Before: Framer Motion causing conflicts
<motion.button
    whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
    whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
    className="..."
>

// After: Pure CSS animations
<button
    className="... hover:scale-105 active:scale-95 will-change-transform"
>
```

### 3. Reduced Backdrop Blur Intensity
**Changes**:
- Changed `backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-sm`
- Reduced gradient opacity from `/5` to `/3`
- Added `will-change-auto` for better performance

```tsx
// Before: Heavy blur causing performance issues
className="... backdrop-blur-md ..."
<div className="... from-primary/5 ... to-secondary/5 ..." />

// After: Lighter effects
className="... backdrop-blur-sm ..."
<div className="... from-primary/3 ... to-secondary/3 will-change-auto ..." />
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations
**Applied**:
- Added `will-change-transform` hints for CSS animations
- Used passive event listeners for scroll and resize
- Optimized transition timings for smoother animations
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders with better debouncing

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Cursor movement caused visual glitching
- ❌ Scroll events triggered frequent state updates
- ❌ Heavy backdrop blur effects caused GPU strain
- ❌ Conflicting animation libraries

### After Fix:
- ✅ Smooth cursor interactions without glitching
- ✅ Optimized scroll handling with proper debouncing
- ✅ Lighter visual effects that maintain performance
- ✅ Consistent CSS-only animations

## Expected Results
1. **Eliminated Glitching**: No more visual artifacts when moving cursor
2. **Smoother Scrolling**: Better scroll performance with optimized event handling
3. **Faster Animations**: Reduced transition times for snappier interactions
4. **Better GPU Usage**: Optimized effects that don't strain graphics performance

## Browser Compatibility
These optimizations work across all modern browsers and provide:
- Better performance on lower-end devices
- Smoother animations on high-refresh displays
- Consistent behavior across different GPU configurations

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- Smooth cursor movement without visual artifacts
- Responsive hover effects on tournament cards
- Fluid scrolling behavior in tournament lists
- No layout shifts or janky animations

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Tournament screen should now be smooth and responsive
