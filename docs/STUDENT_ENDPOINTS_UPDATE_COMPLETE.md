# Student Endpoints Update - Complete

## Summary
Updated all student API endpoints in `academicBackendService.ts` to use the correct backend paths with `/study-area/academic/students/` prefix instead of just `/students/`.

## Changed Endpoints

### Before (incorrect):
```
/students/my-dashboard
/students/my-assignments  
/students/my-grades
/students/my-learning-path
/students/my-study-analytics
/students/my-subjects
/students/my-classes
```

### After (correct):
```
/study-area/academic/students/my-dashboard
/study-area/academic/students/my-assignments
/study-area/academic/students/my-grades
/study-area/academic/students/my-learning-path
/study-area/academic/students/my-study-analytics
/study-area/academic/students/my-subjects
/study-area/academic/students/my-classes
/study-area/academic/students/subject/{subject_id}/progress
```

## Files Modified
- `src/services/academicBackendService.ts` - Updated all endpoint URLs
- Added new `getSubjectProgress(subjectId: number)` method for subject-specific progress

## Key Improvements
1. ✅ All endpoints now use the correct `/study-area/academic/students/` prefix
2. ✅ Added proper error status code handling (404 detection)
3. ✅ Maintained fallback data functionality for development
4. ✅ Added subject progress endpoint
5. ✅ Updated all error messages to reflect correct endpoint paths

## Expected Results
The frontend should now make API calls to the correct backend endpoints:
- No more 404 errors for endpoints that exist in the backend
- Proper fallback data when endpoints are truly missing
- Correct routing to the academic management module

## Next Steps
1. Test the frontend to verify it's calling the correct endpoints
2. Verify backend responses match the expected data structures
3. Remove fallback data once all backend endpoints are confirmed working
4. Add proper error handling for non-404 backend errors

## Testing
Use the browser dev tools Network tab to verify the correct API calls are being made to:
- `GET /study-area/academic/students/my-dashboard`
- `GET /study-area/academic/students/my-assignments`
- `GET /study-area/academic/students/my-grades`
- etc.
