### 🔥 **GRAPH DISPLAY ISSUE - RESOLVED**

**Issue Identified:** June 30, 2025  
**Problem:** Graph images were being generated but not accessible/displayable in chat  
**Root Cause:** Missing static file serving route for `/uploads` directory  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

#### **🛠️ Fix Implementation:**

**1. Static File Serving Route Added:**
```javascript
// Serve graph uploads directory  
const UPLOADS_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');
app.use('/uploads', express.static(UPLOADS_DIR));
app.use('/api/kana/uploads', express.static(UPLOADS_DIR));
```

**2. Function Call Parsing Fixed:**
```javascript
// Check all parts for function calls, not just the first one
const parts = response.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts || [];
const functionCall = parts.find(part => part.functionCall)?.functionCall;
```

**3. Directory Creation Ensured:**
```javascript
// Ensure uploads directory exists for graphs
const UPLOADS_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');
if (!fs.existsSync(UPLOADS_DIR)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(UPLOADS_DIR, { recursive: true });
}
```

#### **✅ Validation Test Results:**
