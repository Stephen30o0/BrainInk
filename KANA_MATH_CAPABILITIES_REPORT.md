## 🤖 **AI Model Tool Usage Analysis**

### ⚠️ **Current Challenge: Inconsistent Tool Usage**
While K.A.N.A. understands graph requests and has access to the `generate_graph_data` tool, the AI model is not consistently using it when requested.

#### **Observed Behavior:**
- **Recognition:** ✅ AI understands graph requests
- **Tool Awareness:** ✅ AI mentions the graph generation tool  
- **Tool Usage:** ❌ AI provides text explanations instead of using the tool
- **Mathematical Knowledge:** ✅ AI provides accurate mathematical explanations

#### **Test Results:**
```
Simple Graph Requests:
- "graph y = x" → Text response (tool not used)
- "plot y = x^2" → Text response (tool not used)  
- "graph y = sin(x)" → Text response (tool not used)
- "draw y = 2x + 1" → Text response (tool not used)

Success Rate: 0/15 advanced expressions generated graphs
Partial Success: 6/15 expressions received mathematical explanations
Error Rate: 9/15 expressions caused 500 errors
```
