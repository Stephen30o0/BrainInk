    "abstract": "Despite remarkable advances, current augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications are a largely individual and local experience. Interconnected AR/VR, where participants can virtually interact across vast distances, remains a distant dream. The great barrier that stands between current technology and such applications is the stringent end-to-end latency requirement, which should not exceed 20 ms in order to avoid motion sickness and other discomforts. Bringing AR/VR to the next level to enable immersive interconnected AR/VR will require significant advances towards 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and a Tactile Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, we articulate the technical challenges to enable a future AR/VR end-to-end architecture, that combines 5G URLLC and Tactile IoT technology to support this next generation of interconnected AR/VR applications. Through the use of IoT sensors and actuators, AR/VR applications will be aware of the environmental and user context, supporting human-centric adaptations of the application logic, and lifelike interactions with the virtual environment. We present potential use cases and the required technological building blocks. For each of them, we delve into the current state of the art and challenges that need to be addressed before the dream of remote AR/VR interaction can become reality",

    "abstract": "Control interfaces and interactions based on touch-less gesture tracking devices have become a prevalent research topic in both industry and academia. Touch-less devices offer a unique interaction immediateness that makes them ideal for applications where direct contact with a physical controller is not desirable. On the other hand, these controllers inherently lack active or passive haptic feedback to inform users about the results of their interaction. Mid-air haptic interfaces, such as those using focused ultrasound waves, can close the feedback loop and provide new tools for the design of touch-less, un-instrumented control interactions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the growing mid-air haptic research community to identify and discuss future challenges in control interfaces and their application in AR/VR, automotive, music, robotics and teleoperation",

      "abstract": "The potential of some technological innovations for a long period of time remains either not fully explored or underestimated. The article gives a brief description of the AR and VR technologies, shows the possibilities of their use in various sectors and industries of the modern world economy. The paper provides an overview of the positive aspects and competitive advantages that AR and VR technologies can bring to companies engaged in the development and production of devices and instruments that allow using these technologies. This is a growth in sales of products and services, a reduction in operating costs, an increase in customer satisfaction, an improvement in the quality of product, services and service. The study also considers the limitations of using AR and VR technologies in educational environments. According to the authors, there are more industries and areas where AR and VR technologies can be applied.The paper analyses the volume of investments in the field of VR / AR, gives the forecasts of possible improvements of VR and AR devices, leading to creating of wider opportunities for their utilization in industrial, financial and educational spheres. The article presents the most successful examples of the implementation of AR and VR technologies in 2012-2021 in foreign and Russian companies. For statistical confirmation of the obtained results the authors performed a correlation analysis of the forecast estimates of the development of AR and VR technologies in 2021–2023. The paper makes the forecast of sales of technologies and devices in some sectors of the economy by 2024. Based on the analysis, the study concludes that there is a significant relationship between the electronics market as a whole and the VR/AR market",

We investigate the\ngeneralization to both non pure states and arbitrary spectral triples.

The sources on Pythagoras are all much later than his life, and often unreliable or hagiographical; whereas for Plato we have a large corpus of his own writings—which nevertheless are not simple to interpret. Plato and Aristotle regard Pythagoras as primarily a religious figure, not a mathematician or natural philosopher. A sharp distinction between Pythagoras as religious figure and Pythagoras as natural philosopher and mathematician may not be the best interpretation. Plato’s cosmology constructs a highly ordered cosmos, in which mathematical forms (circles, regular solids, and simple ratios) play a decisive role. Several thinkers influenced by the work of Pythagoras or Plato are also treated: Archytas, Eudoxus, and Philolaus",

They have critiqued the sexual language of ‘deep penetration’ and ‘orgasmic whumps’ used to describe nuclear arms race technology and argued that sexuality and gender were central to high‐level political decision‐making and everyday experiences of the conflict.1 Scholars have also begun to question the inverse relationship: they have used the politics of the Cold War as a lens into the history of feminist knowledge production itself. Kelly Coogan‐Gehr's 2011 monograph, for example, challenges conventional genealogies tracing feminist scholarship in the ‘West’ back to the ‘new social movements’ of the 1960s and to women's movements, in particular.2 She argues Cold War pressures have privileged certain ideologies (neoliberal capitalism) and knowledge producers (white women) at the expense of others (socialism, communism and black feminist thinkers) in the preeminent feminist journal, Signs, since its inception in 1975",
